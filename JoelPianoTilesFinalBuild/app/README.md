**README**

**Note: for code I had written**
The tutorial I mainly followed outlined in my Project Proposal was not the best, it was just a straight half hour screencast of someone writing code.
I've gone through and written the code from the tutorial and commeneted it as well. I saved a .zip of the source code I copied.
So you can have a look at it, as i'm pretty sure you wanted to look at the source code we used to confirm what we changed.
My inital comments are still in it as well, so you can see any inital misconceptions I had. Aside from that I adapted some
Firebase tutorials to my project to make a leaderboard. All sources are detailed at the end of this document.

 **Features missing from my project**

**Second Gamemode:**
The tutorial I followed had tiles moving down a set grid. I was not able to adapt this to be dynamic with moving rows.

**Music:**
	To accomplish this, I could have made an array of piano notes at different octaves that loop through an array to make a song. With the sounds playing on each onclick event.
	 For example, something simple like hot cross buns. The main issue with this was a time constraint.

**Group?**
	
	
	I did not work in a group for this assignment.
